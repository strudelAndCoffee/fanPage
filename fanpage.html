            and Neil Peart (pronounced 'peert') plays drums, percussion, and is the main lyricist of

            Their two bets known albums are <cite>2112</cite> (1976) and <cite>Moving Pictures</cite> (1981),
            both of which display their mastery of progressive rock exploration fused with radio-friendly 
            pop rock sensibility.
